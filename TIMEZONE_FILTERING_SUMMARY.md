# Timezone Filtering Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The system needed to filter fired signals in the backtest logic to only include those within the last 720 minutes (12 hours), with proper timezone handling and TOKENS filtering.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. UTC Time Filtering ‚è∞
- **Problem**: Previous code had confusing variable names and comments about "local timestamp"
- **Solution**: Clarified that the 5th field in FIRED logs is actually `entry_time` in UTC format
- **Implementation**: Updated `load_fired_signals_from_log()` to parse `entry_time` as UTC and filter based on current UTC time

### 2. TOKENS List Filtering üéØ
- **Problem**: Backtest was processing all discovered symbols, including unwanted BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT
- **Solution**: Added filtering to only process symbols that exist in the TOKENS list from main.py
- **Implementation**: Modified `run_pec_backtest()` to filter `discovered_symbols` by TOKENS list

### 3. UTC String Preservation üìÑ
- **Problem**: CSV output was converting timestamps to local time format
- **Solution**: Preserve original UTC string from logs in CSV output
- **Implementation**: Use `original_entry_time_utc` variable to maintain the exact string from logs

### 4. Documentation & Comments üìù
- **Problem**: Misleading comments about timezone handling
- **Solution**: Added clear comments explaining UTC vs local time handling
- **Implementation**: Updated function docstrings and inline comments

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
- `pec_backtest.py` - Main changes to filtering logic

### Key Functions Updated
1. `load_fired_signals_from_log()` - UTC time filtering
2. `run_pec_backtest()` - TOKENS filtering and UTC preservation

## Test Results ‚úÖ

### Time Filtering Test
```
Current UTC time: 2025-07-13 14:21:53 UTC
Cutoff time: 2025-07-13 02:21:53 UTC

Signals found: 5 total
Signals within 720 minutes: 5 (all recent enough)
```

### TOKENS Filtering Test  
```
All symbols found: ['BTC-USDT', 'ELDE-USDT', 'ETH-USDT', 'LA-USDT', 'SPK-USDT']
Symbols in TOKENS list: ['ELDE-USDT', 'LA-USDT', 'SPK-USDT'] 
Symbols excluded: ['BTC-USDT', 'ETH-USDT'] ‚úÖ
```

### UTC Preservation Test
```
Entry times preserved as original UTC strings:
- 2025-07-13T09:10:28.802346 ‚úÖ
- 2025-07-13T08:15:30.152604 ‚úÖ  
- 2025-07-13T07:26:38.152604 ‚úÖ
```

## Final Result üéØ

The backtest now correctly:
1. ‚úÖ Filters signals by UTC entry_time within last 720 minutes
2. ‚úÖ Only processes tokens from the TOKENS list (excludes BTC/ETH)
3. ‚úÖ Preserves original UTC timestamp strings in CSV output
4. ‚úÖ Has clear documentation about timezone handling

**Impact**: From 5 total signals ‚Üí 3 filtered signals ready for PEC backtest (excluded BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT as required)
